Tower Defend 3D
In this project I tried back to tower defender genre but with use 3D.
My part of this work was assets searhing and coworking with music creator. In code partly I integrated old mechanics and started create UI side.
Nowadays the project is freezed, because of my thesis project.
I learned how communicate with people who doesn't involved in game industry and how use old scripts in new project.
